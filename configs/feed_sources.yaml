# ── User Profile (for AI filtering in workflow Step 2) ──────────────
user_profile:
  max_articles: 7
  language: "bilingual"  # English content + Chinese translation
  trigger: "manual"      # /rss_briefing, not cron
  timeframe: "since_last" # since last briefing, not fixed window

  # ── Slot allocation (7 total) ─────────────────────────────────────
  # This is the core design decision for every briefing.
  #
  #   🧠 Engineering Craft:       2-3 slots  (highest value)
  #   🏗️ Architecture:            1-2 slots  (tied with personal)
  #   💰 Investing:               1 slot     (personal interest)
  #   📖 Literature:              1 slot     (personal interest)
  #   🤖 AI/Tech Background:      1 slot     (combined summary)
  #
  # The AI background slot should COMPRESS multiple AI news items
  # into a single combined entry — "what you need to know this week."
  # Do NOT give AI/tech news multiple slots unless something is
  # genuinely paradigm-shifting.
