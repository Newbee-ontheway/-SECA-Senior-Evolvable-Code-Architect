description: Generate a personalized briefing from RSS feeds — AI filters based on user preferences

# RSS Daily Briefing Workflow

> **Canonical location**: `_ai_evolution/workflows/rss_briefing.md`
> Portable skill. Copy `_ai_evolution/` to any project to reuse.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- `pip install feedparser pyyaml`
- Feed sources + user profile in `_ai_evolution/configs/feed_sources.yaml`

## Steps

### Step 1: Fetch RSS Data
// turbo
Run the fetcher script. Use `--days N` based on when the last briefing was generated
(check `readings/` for the latest `*-briefing.md` file):

```
python _ai_evolution/scripts/rss_fetcher.py --days <N> --json
```

If there is no previous briefing, default to `--days 3`.
Capture the JSON output for the next step.

### Step 2: AI Selection (Critical Step)
Read `user_profile` from `feed_sources.yaml`. Apply these rules **strictly**:

1. **Max articles**: `user_profile.max_articles` (default: 7). NEVER exceed this.
2. **Priority filtering**:
   - Priority 1 topics get 3-4 of the 7 slots
   - Priority 2 topics get 2-3 slots
   - Priority 3 topics get 0-1 slot (only if exceptionally high quality)
3. **Tier weighting**: Tier 1 sources get priority over Tier 2 for equal-quality articles
4. **Low-interest filter**: Skip articles matching `low_interest` topics unless they are genuinely landmark events
5. **Deduplication**: If multiple sources cover the same event, pick the best analysis, not the first to publish

Selection criteria (in priority order):
1. Directly actionable for user's current work (agent engineering, knowledge systems)
2. Original thinking or frameworks (not news summaries or link roundups)
3. Breakthrough announcements that change the landscape
4. Practical tutorials with high signal-to-noise ratio
5. Contrarian or critical viewpoints that challenge assumptions

**Skip**: link-only posts, sponsor content, routine changelog updates, "X raised $Y" funding news, listicles.

### Step 3: Fetch Full Article Text
For each selected article (≤7), use `read_url_content` to fetch full text.
If an article fails to load, note it and select a replacement from the candidate pool.

### Step 4: Generate Briefing (Bilingual)
Create a structured briefing document. **All content must be bilingual** (English + Chinese translation). Links stay in English.

Format:

```markdown
# Briefing — YYYY-MM-DD

> Source: [collection name] | N selected from M total (since last briefing: YYYY-MM-DD)
> 来源：[集合名] | 从 M 篇中选出 N 篇（上次简报：YYYY-MM-DD）

## 🔥 Top Story / 头条
[English summary — 2-3 sentences]
[中文翻译]
> 📎 [Title](URL)

## [Theme] / [主题]
- **[Title]** (Author) — [1-2 sentence English summary]
  [中文翻译]
  > 📎 [Source](URL)

## 💡 Synthesis / 综合洞察
[English: 2-3 sentences connecting themes]
[中文翻译]

---
*Generated by RSS Briefing Skill | N sources, M articles reviewed, K selected*
```

Rules:
- Group by **theme**, not by blog
- Each summary: **1-2 sentences max**, capture the key insight
- Synthesis: show **connections** between stories, not random thoughts
- Chinese translation should be natural, not machine-literal

### Step 5: Save and Report
1. Save briefing to `readings/YYYY-MM-DD-briefing.md` (project root level)
2. If individual articles are worth full archiving, save to `readings/YYYY-MM-DD-author-slug.md`
3. Report to user: article count, themes, top story highlight

## Feed Source Management

Edit `_ai_evolution/configs/feed_sources.yaml` to:
- Change RSS sources (add/remove feeds)
- Adjust user preferences (topics, priorities, max articles)
- No code changes needed

```bash
# Swap to different sources
python _ai_evolution/scripts/rss_fetcher.py --config path/to/other.yaml --days 3 --json
```

## Portability

To migrate to a new project:
1. Copy `_ai_evolution/` folder
2. Create `readings/` at project root
3. Edit `feed_sources.yaml` — update user_profile and feeds
4. Run `/rss_briefing`
